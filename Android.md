### Tell us what your idea is. 

- There are 3 parts to this idea
  - The Music Generator
  - Web Browsing Tracker
  - The Explorer 
- While the project will initially just focus on the first part and if successful will extend it to the second. 
- The Music Generator is supposed to generate background music based on the video that is put in and processed. It will generate a mood analysis based on the video and suggest how the communication material will vary according to the different apt choices available.
- The Web Browsing Tracker will help you control your browsing time on the web. This application can be built for Android as well as, as an extension for browsers on the web. It will undersatnd your browsing patterns and predict the time you spend on certain sites based on your browsing history. This can then be used to block websites to control browsing. 


### Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 
 
- While I haven't written any ML codes prior to this, I have worked with android app development and I plan to bring this app to life by following various tutorials but most importantly using research papers that I have been reading.
- Google can help me by speeding up my understanding of ml and with code reviews often as possible. 
- We are working on a very detailed timeline,  we will attach the link as soon as we are done. 



### Tell us about you. 

I am a keen learner and an experience seeker. I feel that taking up something you are absolutely clueless about gives you an experience and learning that you don't just retain but cherish all your life. 
I come from multilingual multicultural background, and hence value and understand the importance of communication and perspective. 
I feel coordination and strong communication lead to a smoother flow in an organisation, not just on a commercial level but more importantly on a development level. Great communication is what makes an idea a trend and calls for a revolution.
This understanding of how perspectives and lack of proper communication can lead to misunderstandings which inturn can lead to loss not just in time but also can be discouraging to the people putting efforts, is what I feel makes me fit for the role.
